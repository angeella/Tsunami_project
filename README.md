## Predicting the Impact of COVID-19 on the Emergency Departments in Lombardy, Italy

Here, you can find the [code](https://github.com/angeella/Tsunami_project/tree/main/Code) used during the TSUNAMI project and the [slides](https://github.com/angeella/Tsunami_project/tree/main/JSM_slides) used in the JSM 2021 conference. The code is not entirely reproducible since some data are not open source.

In [example.R](https://github.com/angeella/Tsunami_project/tree/main/example.R) you can predict the number of emergency events/calls for each Lombardy areas.
