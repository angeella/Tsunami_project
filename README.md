Here, you can find the [code](https://github.com/angeella/Tsunami_project/tree/main/Code) used during the TSUNAMI project and the [slides](https://github.com/angeella/Tsunami_project/tree/main/JSM_slides) used in the JSM 2021 conference. The code is not entirely reproducible since some data are not open source.
